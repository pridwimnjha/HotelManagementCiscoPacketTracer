# HotelManagementCiscoPacketTracer
I built a Cisco Packet Tracer project to simulate a complete enterprise network for Hotel management system.

Project Highlights:

Designed a three-floor network topology with routers placed in a central server room (IT Department).

Configured inter-router communication via serial DCE cables with subnetting using /30 networks.

Implemented VLAN segmentation for all departments across 3 floors with dedicated IP subnets and DHCP configuration.

Integrated Wi-Fi networks on each floor to support laptops and mobile devices.

Configured DHCP servers on routers to assign dynamic IP addresses.

Enabled OSPF routing to ensure inter-VLAN communication across departments.

Set up SSH access for secure remote login on all routers.

Added a Test-PC in the IT department to validate SSH access.

Implemented port security on the IT switch to restrict access on a specific port (Fa0/1) to the Test-PC only.

Ensured all departments have network printers and proper communication flow.


This project helped me strengthen my skills in routing, switching, VLAN configuration, subnetting, security, and network troubleshooting.
